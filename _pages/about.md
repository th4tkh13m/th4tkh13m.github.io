Hello! I'm Khiem, a Ph.D. student in Data Science at NJIT. My research focuses on Artificial Intelligence, particularly in the areas of Large Language Models (LLMs), Reinforcement Learning, and their applications in software engineering and security. I am passionate about exploring the capabilities and limitations of AI systems, and I am dedicated to advancing the field through innovative research and collaboration.

In my free time, I enjoy playing guitar. My favorite artist is John Lennon, as well as The Beatles. Besides music, I also have a keen interest in cooking and trying out new recipes.

Feel free to reach out to me through the contact information provided below. I'm always interested in collaborating on interesting projects and connecting with fellow developers and professionals.
